      Iraq, officially known as the Republic of Iraq, is a country in Western Asia, located in the region commonly referred to as the Middle East. It has a rich history and diverse cultural heritage, being home to some of the world's earliest known civilizations. The land that is now Iraq was historically known as Mesopotamia, often called the "Cradle of Civilization," where the Sumerian, Akkadian, Babylonian, and Assyrian empires flourished.

      The modern nation-state of Iraq was created following World War I. Its capital, Baghdad, once served as the capital of the Abbasid Caliphate and became a significant cultural and intellectual center during the Islamic Golden Age.

      Iraq's population is over 46 million, making it the 31st-most populous country. It is a federal parliamentary republic consisting of 19 governorates. The country is diverse in its ethnic makeup, primarily consisting of Arabs and Kurds, with other groups including Turkmen, Assyrians, and Yazidis. The official languages are Arabic and Kurdish, with English also recognized as a co-official language in some contexts.

      Iraq's economy is largely driven by the oil sector, which has been a significant source of revenue and economic activity. However, the country has faced challenges, including political instability, conflicts, and efforts to rebuild and recover from periods of violence and sanctions.

      The country has been a battleground for competing forces, especially since the US-led overthrow of Saddam Hussein in 2003. The mainly Shia-led governments have struggled to maintain order, and the country has seen only brief periods of respite from high levels of sectarian violence.

      Iraq continues to be an important player in the geopolitical landscape of the Middle East, with its history, resources, and strategic location shaping its role in regional and global affairs.

      Iraq, a nation with a storied past and a vibrant present, is divided into 18 governorates, each with its own unique identity and history. These governorates range from the vast Al Anbar in the west to the bustling metropolis of Baghdad. They are not just administrative divisions but are also reflective of the country’s diverse cultural and geographical landscape.

      At the core of these governorates lies Baghdad, the capital city. Founded in the 8th century, Baghdad was once the epicenter of the Islamic Golden Age, where scholars, poets, and artists thrived. Today, it stands as a testament to resilience, rebuilding itself time and again to remain the political, economic, and cultural hub of Iraq.

      Flowing through the heart of Iraq are the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, cradling the birthplace of civilization. These rivers have been the source of life and prosperity for the region, giving rise to the fertile lands that nurtured the earliest human settlements and empires known to history.

      Iraq’s flag is a powerful emblem of unity, with its horizontal tricolor of red, white, and black stripes. In the center, the white band bears the Takbir, “Allahu Akbar,” in green Kufic script, symbolizing faith and the nation’s Islamic heritage.

      The national anthem of Iraq, “Mawtini” (My Homeland), is a stirring ode to the country. Adopted in 2004, it is a beloved poem by the Palestinian poet Ibrahim Tuqan, set to music by the Lebanese composer Mohammed Flayfel. It resonates with the Iraqi people’s love for their land and their aspirations for peace and prosperity.<br>
